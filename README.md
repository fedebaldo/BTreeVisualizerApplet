# BTreeVisualizerApplet
Applet to visualize BTree

This Applet is an attempt to provide a visualizer for BTree data structure. 
My work is the prosecution of Davide Donato's project.  

To compile from bash:

- javac b_trees_visualizer/graphic_interface/Applet.java
- appletviewer applet.html 

The applet is divided in two parts. 
The first part helps understanding how BTree works by visualizing the data structure
The second part generates random exercise to be solved by the student redrawing the correct BTree.
In the field Draw Root you can insert the text that will represent the keys displayed in the root of 
the tree you are drawing. The keys must be integers and  divided by commas.
For Example

	4,5,6,7
