# BTreeVisualizerApplet
Applet to visualize BTree

This Applet is an attempt to provide a visualizer for BTree data structure. 
My work is the prosecution of Davide Donato's project. 
I'm not good with GUIs, please be lienent with me. 

To compile from bash:

- cd src 
- javac b_trees_visualizer/graphic_interface/Applet.java
- appletviewer src/applet.html 

In this moment the applet is still in development phase
